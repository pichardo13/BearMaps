Though we started working on the project on time and
consistently worked on it, we ran into several bugs
throughout the past couple days and therefore had to
spend time running all the tests and debugging.
We were mostly finished before the day of the deadline, but we
wanted to fix an error in an edge case for our shortestPaths
method. We had not encountered this edge case in our previous
implementations.
